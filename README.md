# Tractian Mobile Software Engineer Challenge

This repository is part of the [Tractian Mobile Software Engineer Challenge](https://github.com/tractian/challenges/blob/main/mobile/README.md).

## Challenge Overview

The challenge is to build an asset management mobile application, following strict UI and functionality specifications outlined in the provided documentation. The app is built using Flutter and includes recursive tree structures to display a large number of assets, sub-assets, locations, and components.

## Improvements

The key improvements I would implement include:

- **Code Refactoring**: 
   - Refactor the codebase to enhance readability and maintainability, making it easier for future developers to understand and contribute to the project.
   
- **Project Structure**: 
   - Reorganize the project for better scalability and to support future feature implementations more efficiently.
   
- **State Management**:
   - Implement a state management solution using packages like [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) or [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for better handling of app states, improving performance and code structure.
